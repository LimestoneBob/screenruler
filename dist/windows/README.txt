## Build instructions

To build an executable from pyinstaller or auto-py-to-exe a few changes must be made.
first: Move the conversions.py module to the root directory of screenruler.py
second: If the default tk icon is going to be changed;
      Add correct path to script for app icon:
        ex.. self = Tk()
             self.iconbitmap(r'E:\screenruler\favicon.ico')
             ** self.iconbitmap(resource_path('favicon.ico')) To ensure correct packaging of binary the resource_path script must be used.
      Add to pyinstaller
             --add-binary "favicon.ico;."
